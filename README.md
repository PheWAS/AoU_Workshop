These are materials demonstrating PheWAS in the All of Us Researcher Workbench

To load these notebooks, create a new python notebook and add three cells with the following commands:

`!wget https://github.com/PheWAS/AoU_Workshop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`

`!unzip -j main.zip `

`!gsutil cp AMIA* $WORKSPACE_BUCKET/notebooks`

This will download the notebooks and then save them to your workspace so you can view them.
